# JON - TODO

This is a todo list app (oh no, there are thousands of these everywhere!) I decided to develop in order to show what I can currently do with Node.js and related technologies.

Here I'm using Node.js with TypeScript, MongoDB and Docker.

As my focus is on backend development, I'll develop the frontend part later.
